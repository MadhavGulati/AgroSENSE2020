# AgroSENSE Mobile App

# OverView 
The AgroSENSE app is a complete guide for users to build and maintain a hydroponics system. Users are given a step-by-step video and written instructions to build their ideal system. In addition, the app also contains maintenance guides for hydroponics and healthy cooking recipes.

# Design
The AgroSENSE mobile app is built to help users set up their own hydroponics system with ease. Users first take a survey to generate their ideal systems by taking into account their specific parameters: type of fish, plants, size, budget, and various other factors.Upon completion of the survey, users will be given written instructions and a tutorial video to start the building process. The app is split into 2 sections: Builder’s Guide and Community Guide. The Builder’s Guide includes all the information users will need to set up their own aquaponics/hydroponics system. The Community Guide will serve as the education portion; it will address certain topics such as how to maintain the system and include the AgroEats cookbook, containing a diverse array of recipes using the plants harvested from their system. AgroSENSE’s  Builder’s and Community Guides  serve as a perfect introduction to hydroponics for beginners.
